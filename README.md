# Hong Kong Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Locator
Centralising Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Data in Hong Kong

### Project Synopsis

There are three ATM networks in Hong Kong, which are HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and JETCO respectively. ATM data will be retrieved via API Portal from HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and APIX. However, the interoperability is frustrating as the API is implemented at different standard levels. Hence, this project aims to centralise Hong Kong ATM data in a well-defined yet standardised format and display in a web portal for public use. 


Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has published [Open API Framework for the Hong Kong Banking Sector](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-information/press-release/2018/20180718e5a2.pdf), mentioning that no standardised open API functions will be provided at the first release.

Paragraph #20
> Throughout the discussion and consultation period, the HKMA recognises the industry’s desire to see a common set of Open APIs for better interoperability. However, a number of international banks operating in Hong Kong have already implemented their group standard for implementing Open APIs at global or regional levels, and have demonstrated elsewhere that requiring banks to adhere to a prescribed set of standardised Open API functions is challenging.

Paragraph #21
> Some opinions from the technology sector also indicate that it would be more desirable for banks to quickly offer Open APIs than to wait for standardised Open APIs that would take time to emerge. Furthermore, it is believed that once an ecosystem has been developed and becomes mature, convergence to standardised Open APIs will likely occur in response to the needs of the market.
